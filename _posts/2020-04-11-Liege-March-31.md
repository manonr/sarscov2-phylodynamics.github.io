## Background information  




#### This analysis is based on : 
  
* **50 whole genomes** sampled from **within Liège**
* **73 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **Liège**
* Samples within Liège were collected between **2020-03-05** and **2020-03-31**


These numbers will differ from the number of uploaded sequences as we remove sequences with likely sequencing errors or significant gaps. Sequences were deduplicated prior to analyses.

## How many are infected in Liège?

Using a phylodynamic model we estimate epidemiological parameters using SARS-CoV 2 sequence data from Liège together with a background set of sequences sampled from the larger internationational viral population. [The model is explained in detail here](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/seijr0.1.0_methods.pdf). Reported case numbers for comparison are extracted from [Sciensano, the Belgian instute for health](https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/).

*Figure 1: Cumulative estimated infections through time. Points represent reported cases in Liège. The dashed line indicates the date of last sample in Liège in this analysis.*


* Estimated cumulative infections at last sample (2020-03-31): **57257 [1-190723]** median [95%CI]

* Cumulative confirmed infections reported at 2020-03-31: **1854**

* Percent of estimated cumlutive infections (see Figure 3) which are reported confirmed infections at 2020-03-21: **3.24**

*Figure 2: Daily estimated infections through time. Points represent reported cases in Liège. The dashed line indicates the date of last sample in Liège in this analysis.*

Towards the end of the curve the estimated number of daily infections starts to decrease. This may be due to the shutting of all non-essential activities on 2020-03-18 across Belgium. However, further anlayses are required to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission in this region.

*Figure 3: Estimated daily reporting rate of cases in Liège. Note that the CI of reporting rate (not shown) extends to 100% on most days due to very high imprecision of epidemic size estimates.*

The percentage of estimated cases which were confirmed reported cases between 2020-03-01 and 2020-03-31 ranged from 1.12 to 6.32% over time with a mean of 4.71%, however there is very high uncertainty in these estimates corresponding to imprecision of epidemic size estimates. The mean estimated reporting rate is similar to previous findings [reported by Russell et al using case fatality ratio estimates.](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html)

*Figure 4: Reproduction number through time. The vertical dashed line indicates the date of last sample in Liège in this analysis.*

Reproduction number at last sample (2020-03-31): **0.912 [0.105-2.58]** median [95% CrI]


## How quickly has the epidemic in Liège grown?







| Quantile | Reproduction number | Growth rate (per day) | Doubling time (days) |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
|   50%    |        3.43         |         0.216         |         3.1          |
|   2.5%   |        0.476        |        -0.0765        |        --         |
|  97.5%   |        5.42         |         0.338         |         3.96         |
