## Background information  




#### This is analysis is based on : 
  
* **20 whole genomes** sampled from **within Weifang**
* **50 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **Weifang**
* Samples within Weifang were collected between **2020-01-23** and **2020-03-09**

## How many are infected in Weifang?

* Estimated cumulative infections at last sample (2020-03-09): **223 [38-827]** median [95%CI]

* Cumulative confirmed infections reported at 2020-03-09:
