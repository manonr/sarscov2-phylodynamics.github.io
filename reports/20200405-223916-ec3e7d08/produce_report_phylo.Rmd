# Phylodynamic analysis: `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")`, `r last_tip`


### Primary author: `r primary_authors`

### Report prepared on `r pres_date`

#### On behalf of the MRC GIDA COVID-19 phylodynamics working group at Imperial College London: `r pres_author`

```{r arguments from orderly , echo = F, include = F}

r_table <- read.csv("R_and_growth_rate.csv")


r_table$Growth.rate..per.day. <- formatC(signif(r_table$Growth.rate..per.day.,digits=3), digits=3,format="fg", flag="#")



colnames(r_table) <- c("Quantile", "Reproduction number", "Growth rate (per day)", "Doubling time (days)")



```


## Background information  




#### This is analysis is based on : 
  
* **`r n_genomes_Il` whole genomes** sampled from **within `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")`**
* **`r n_genomes_exog` whole genomes** sampled from outside of **`r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")`**
* Samples within `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")` were collected between **`r first_tip`** and **`r last_tip`**


##### To add: [optional plot of sample distribution through time]



## How many are infected in `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")`?





```{r Cumulative estimated infections through time, fig.cap="Figure 1: Cumulative estimated infections through time. Points represent reported cases in the region.",  out.width = "90%",echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("SEIJR_plot_size.png")
```

* Estimated cumulative infections at last sample (`r last_tip`): **`r info$infections_at_last_tip` [`r info$infections_at_last_tip_lower`-`r info$infections_at_last_tip_upper`]** median [95%CI]

* Cumulative confirmed infections reported at `r last_tip`: 
**`r info$confirmed_infections_last_tip`**  

* Cumulative number of active infections at `r last_tip`:  



```{r daily estimated infections through time, fig.cap="Figure 2: Daily estimated infections through time. Points represent reported cases in the region.",  out.width = "90%",  echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Daily.png")
```






```{r Rt, fig.cap="Figure 3: Reproduction number through time",  out.width = "90%",  echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Rt.png")
```


Reproduction number at last sample (`r last_tip`): **`r info$Rt_at_last_tip` [`r info$Rt_at_last_tip_lower`-`r info$Rt_at_last_tip_upper`]** median [95% CrI]


## How quickly has the epidemic in `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")` grown?



```{r table_proportion_age,  echo = F}

# xtable(r_table)

if (doc.type == "docx") { pander::pander(r_table, caption ="Table 1: Reproduction number, growth rate and doubling times") } else { 
r_table %>%
  kable(caption = "Table 1: Reproduction number, growth rate and doubling times", align = "cccc") %>%
  kable_styling( full_width = F, position = "left")
}


```





## How has SARS-CoV 2 evolved in `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")`?



```{r mcc_tree, fig.cap="Figure 4: Time scaled phylogeny co-estimated with epidemiological parameters. The colour of the tips corresponds to location sampling; red tips were sampled from within the region, blue tips from outside",  out.width = "400px",echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("mcc.png")
```




##### Molecular clock rate of evolution: **`r format(median(clock_rate), digits=3)` [`r format(quantile(clock_rate, c(0.025)), digits=3)`-`r format(quantile(clock_rate, c(0.975)), digits=3)`]** median [95% CrI]  

<!-- #### (optional) Number of introductions into `r str_to_title(location, locale = "en")` (someone needs to write code to compute this) -->




## Predicted cumulative infections over next 14 days (assuming exponential growth):



```{r predicted infections through time, fig.cap="Figure 5: Cumulative estimated infections. The dashed line indicates the date of last sample in analysis. The points represent reported cases in the region.",  out.width = "90%",  echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("cumu_inf_exp_model.png")
```

Predicted reproduction number at `r info$dates[2]` (`r as.integer(as.Date(info$dates[2])- as.Date(info$last_tip))` days after last sample): 
median [95% CrI]
[to add!]
