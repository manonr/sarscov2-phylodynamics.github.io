Our mission is to advance epidemiological surveillance of COVID19 by studying the evolution of SARS Coronavirus 2. 
By using publicly available virus genomic data, phylogenetic analysis and advanced population genetic modeling, we aim to shed light on

- Growth and decline of COVID19 in various populations
- Epidemic origins 
- The impact of public health interventions
- Future epidemic trends 

<!-- 
Evolution of SARS CoV 2 is shaped by epidemiological dynamics and patterns of dispersal between cities, regions and countries.
